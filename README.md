Building for Plugins with React & Flux
----

This sample code demonstrates the concepts we discussed at [ReactEurope 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu4Yz2HmCgE) in a small app that implements a message list with a "mark as read" plugin:

1. Using a single, central DataStore to eliminate store interdependencies and allow plugins to modify data in unexpected ways.

2. Using a ComponentStore to dynamically register and inject components at runtime.

3. Isolating the React.Render calls for third-party "unsafe" components.

#### Getting Started

To run the sample project, run the commands below and visit [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in your browser.

```
npm install
bower install
grunt connect
```

#### Get in touch!
